Available settings:

``QA_DESCRIPTION_OPTIONAL`` This flag disables the validation applied to the 'description' field, allowing title only questions.
The default behaviour is set to ``False``, enforcing the need for a description. If set to ``True``, you will be able to create questions without descriptions.
