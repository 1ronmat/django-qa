A Simple Q&A App using Python Django
====================================
django-qa_ is a fork from Simple-Q-A-App-using-Python-Django_ aimed to create a pluggable package than allows to implement a StackOverflow-like forum site for your Django web project.
The development of this package is kindly supported by SWAPPS_ and constantly developed by it's colaborators. Feel free to use it, add some issues if you find bugs or think of a really cool feature, even clone it and generate a pull requests to incorporate those cool features made by yourself; If you have special requirements, drop us a few lines_ and perhaps we can help you out too.
