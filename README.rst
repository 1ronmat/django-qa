A Simple Q&A App using Python Django
====================================

_django-qa: http://swappsco.github.io/django-qa/ is a fork from _Simple-Q-A-App-using-Python-Django: http://arjunkomath.github.io/Simple-Q-A-App-using-Python-Django aimed to create a pluggable package than allows to implement a StackOverflow-like forum site for your Django web project.
The development of this package is kindly supported by _SWAPPS: https://www.swapps.io/ and constantly developed by it's colaborators. Feel free to use it, add some issues if you find bugs or think of a really cool feature, even clone it and generate a pull requests to incorporate those cool features made by yourself; If you have special requirements, _drop us a few lines: https://www.swapps.io/contact/ and perhaps we can help you out too.
